## Challenge 2 - VBA Stock Analysis

### **Project Overview**
    A practice analysis on coding Macros in Excel's VBA, Refactoring, and Performance Measure using practice data of 2017 & 2018 stocks for analysis for a fictional client.

### **Results**
    After using the base code make sure the macro ran correctly, the refactoring process was able to cut the macro's run time to less than a tenth of a second.

### **Summary**
   ##### *Refactoring Code*
    The major advantage to refactoring is improving the code's logic to reduce the load on the hardware and decrease the run time of the program. The disadvantage is refactoring code that does not already require a high load on the hardware, can be a time waster for the programer as reducing the run time from 2 seconds to less than 1 second is negligible. 

   ##### *Original vs Refactored*
    The Refactored code is faster and is easier to add new elements to should the need arise, but seems over-engineered when the original already solved the issue. The original may have a slightly long processing time, it sloved the issue with simplicity for future user to view.
